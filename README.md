# Java-Core-Test-100-passed


In this evaluation test there were 20 questions that included 5 exercises for each question.
In total, there were 100 problems that needed to be answered as instructed to pass the j-Unit 
testing with a close enough score to 100% to stay in the ‘green’. I resolved the exercise problems 
with solutions that compiled for all 100 problems included in this exam.  This exam truly tests your
ability to think of alternative solutions when executing a task to be completed. The following shows 
the score after compiling the evaluation test in the package :
